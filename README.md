## Getting Started

```
TODO: Give examples

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
